# Task2
1.Generate summary statistics (mean, median, std, etc.).
2.Create histograms and boxplots for numeric features.
3.Use pairplot/correlation matrix for feature relationships.
4. Patterns, trends, anomalies: Done through the plots above

5. Basic feature-level inferences: Use the visuals to observe:
    Outliers in boxplots
    Skewed or normal distributions in histograms
    Strong or weak correlations in the heatmap
    Relationships and clusters in pairplot

interview questions
1. What is the purpose of EDA?
EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) is used to understand the structure and patterns of a dataset. It helps us summarize, clean, and visualize the data so we can make better decisions in the next steps of analysis or machine learning.

2. How do boxplots help in understanding a dataset?
Boxplots show us:
Median,
Quartiles,
Minimum and maximum values,
Outliers

3. What is correlation and why is it useful?
Correlation shows the relationship between two features.
    A positive value means they increase together.
    A negative value means one increases while the other decreases.

4. How do you detect skewness in data?
    Look at histograms: If the curve is stretched more to the left or right, itâ€™s skewed.
    .skew() in pandas can be used.

5. What is multicollinearity?
Multicollinearity means that two or more features are highly correlated with each other.

6. What tools do you use for EDA?
    Pandas
    Matplotlib & Seaborn
    Scikit-learn
    NumPy

8. What is the role of visualization in ML?
Visualization helps us in:
    Understand data faster,
    Spot patterns and errors easily,
